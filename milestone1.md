* __Current law__ :    
>As per FIPPA , any public body must ensure any personal information in its custody should be stored and accessed only in Canada . As per the FIPPA, "personal information" is any data which can directly identify an individual also someone’s personal opinions about something is considered “personal information” if the information is linked or could possibly be linked to the individual. Also , an IP address constitutes indirectly identifying information. 

>If and only if, __we are not collecting any personal information in our survey, then we are free to use whatever online survey tool we prefer__ as long as the survey is completely anonymous – i.e. the online survey tool we are using has the capability to switch off the IP tracking feature (online survey tools collect this information from users as a matter of course).


* __What our survey is collecting__  
>Our survey is collecting non-personal information , like how many hours spent on average studying per week , hours spent sleeping. Both these information even if combined with other quassi data cannot identify any individual. As hours spent studying and sleeping is not unique to any individual . Other information we are collecting is regarding the attendance in lectures , labs and office hours . Which will be collected as generalized information. Like, regular, irregular etc. Hence , that will make the non personal information even more anonymised. We are not collecting any student id or email address so no IP address can be stored by the online survey. The anonymous responses will not be published .

* __Where do we stand according to FIPPA__    
>According to FIPPA, the data we are collecting is not personal information, so we can use any online survey tool(Highlighted in bold in second paragraph under 'Current Law'). Our selected survey tool also has the capacity to switch-off IP tracking. 

>We will create our survey using SurveyMonkey – www.surveymonkey.com , as we are not collecting any personal information also Survey monkey facilitates anonymous responses. Below is the link which states the anonymous response feature of Survey Monkey :
